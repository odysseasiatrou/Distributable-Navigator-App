# java_android-navigator_app
Application developed for academic purposes and implements a navigator for android.

This application is able to draw a colored line from your current position to a destination you wish by just tapping on the map
that is printed as the main layout . The back-end of the app is capable of handling multiple request from different users using the map 
reduce framework.


The back-end part was developed with eclipse and the front-end with AndroidStudio .


This readme file will soon be updated with more details.

Firstly before proceeding to the details of this project , let's first clearly mention what is a distributed environment for the 
newcomers .As i have already mentioned few lines above it was a project developed for a course during my academical studies . Thus , i 
have clear view of what many newcomers whould understand about this app . So let's define what is a distributed environment or more 
accurate what is a distributed system and then we will go further on what is the environment it is operating in .

Definition of Distributed System from techopedia :

A distributed system is a network that consists of autonomous computers that are connected using a distribution middleware. They help in 
sharing different resources and capabilities to provide users with a single and integrated coherent network.

Let's now proceed on what is this actually describing and let's talk in terms of what the environment will be . So :

Keyword No 1 :

It is a network . Network stands for a total number of minimum two PCs . Two Different PCs , autonomous as the reference of the 
definition is . But as we will mention later it is all about the two , as a minimum , different CPUs that are used .

Keyword No 2 :

It uses a distribution middleware . It refers to brokers and software that runs in all PCs to support the communication inside the 
network . One very popular middleware in the java world is CORBA .
